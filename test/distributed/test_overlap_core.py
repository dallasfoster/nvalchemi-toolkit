"""Exactness of the async-overlap two-pass split (proposal §3.0), single-process.

Proves that running an opaque scatter-add message module on the sender-resident
edge bucket (owned features) plus the remote bucket (exchanged features), then
summing, reproduces the full-message reference — through the actual
:func:`run_overlapped` driver + :class:`AsyncExchange`/:class:`LocalityPartition`
protocols. Covers BOTH index-space regimes the two production strategies present:
graph-parallel (exchanged = the full gathered node set) and halo (exchanged = the
``[owned | ghost]`` padded set). No distribution / GPU — this isolates the split
math from the collectives.
