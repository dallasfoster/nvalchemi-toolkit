"""Neighbor list hook for on-the-fly neighbor list construction.

This module provides :class:`NeighborListHook`, which runs at the
``BEFORE_COMPUTE`` stage to compute or refresh the neighbor list stored in
the batch before the model forward pass.  It supports an optional Verlet
skin buffer to avoid recomputing neighbors every step.

Both ``MATRIX`` and ``COO`` neighbor formats are supported for dynamic
updates (i.e. updates each dynamics step).  For ``COO`` format the hook
creates or replaces the edges group on the batch each step so that
``batch.neighbor_list`` (shape ``(E, 2)``) and ``batch.neighbor_list_shifts``
(shape ``(E, 3)``, PBC only) are always up to date.  The companion
``Batch.edge_ptr`` property derives the per-atom CSR pointer on demand.

Pre-allocation
--------------
The hook maintains *staging buffers* — persistent GPU tensors that are
refreshed each step via ``Tensor.copy_()`` — to avoid per-step dynamic
allocation inside the ``neighbor_list`` dispatcher.

For PBC systems, ``NeighborListHook`` runs the ``nvalchemiops`` selector
once per batch shape and caches the resulting explicit strategy name (for
example ``batch_cell_list_pair_centric`` or ``batch_cluster_tile``). For
non-PBC systems it keeps the legacy size threshold between naive and cell-list
methods. The selected paths normally allocate auxiliary tensors on demand with
CPU-GPU syncs (e.g. ``.item()`` calls), so
:meth:`NeighborListHook._alloc_nl_kwargs` computes these **once** when the batch
shape is first seen (or changes) and caches them in
``NeighborListHook._buf_nl_kwargs``:

* *Naive, no PBC*: no extra kwargs needed.
* *Naive, PBC*: ``shift_range_per_dimension``, ``num_shifts_per_system``,
  ``max_shifts_per_system``, and ``max_atoms_per_system``.
* *Cell list*: seven cell-list scratch tensors via ``allocate_cell_list``.
* *Cluster tile*: batch cluster-tile sort/group/tile scratch tensors.

**NPT note**: geometry-dependent kwargs (shift ranges, cell-list sizes) are
fixed when the staging buffers are first allocated for a given ``(N, B)``
shape.  For NPT (variable-cell) simulations the pre-computed values may
become stale as the cell changes; accuracy is maintained by keeping the
cutoff + skin well below the shortest cell dimension throughout the run.

    Used by :class:`NeighborListHook` when constructed with
    ``use_cuda_graph=True``. Owns a private capture stream (one per cache
    instance) so the integrator's default-stream work is unaffected.
    On a NL hook call:

    * ``matches(key)`` returns True if the captured graph corresponds to
      the current ``(N, B, dtype, max_neighbors, has_pbc, has_cell)``
      tuple. The hook builds the key from its already-tracked allocator
      gates; cache invalidation rides along free with the existing
      shape-change detection.
    * ``replay()`` schedules the captured graph on the cache's private
      stream and joins back to the caller's current stream.
    * ``capture(fn, key)`` records ``fn()`` into a fresh
      ``torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`` under ``wp.ScopedStream`` so Warp launches
      attach to the captured stream (the default stream switch
      otherwise creates an event dependency the capture rejects).
      Caller is responsible for warming up ``fn`` once eagerly before
      calling capture so the first-build adaptive-K pass settles
      ``max_neighbors`` before the captured graph fixes it in place.

    Lifetime: a single cache instance lives for the lifetime of the
    hook. ``invalidate()`` drops the captured graph (and lets it be
    re-captured on the next call) — currently unused but useful for
    callers that want to force re-capture without changing shape.

    This hook runs at :attr:`~DynamicsStage.BEFORE_COMPUTE` and writes

    read it.  An optional Verlet skin buffer avoids rebuilding the list
    every step: the list is only recomputed when the maximum atomic
    displacement since the last build exceeds ``config.skin / 2``, or when
    the set of active systems changes (detected via ``system_id``).

    For ``MATRIX`` format the following tensors are written to the atoms
    group of the batch (and thus accessible as ``batch.neighbor_matrix``
    etc.):

    * ``neighbor_matrix`` — shape ``(N, max_neighbors)``, int32
    * ``num_neighbors``   — shape ``(N,)``, int32
    * ``neighbor_matrix_shifts`` — shape ``(N, max_neighbors, 3)``, int32
      (only written when PBC is active)

    For ``COO`` format the edges group of the batch is created or replaced
    on every rebuild, making the following accessible:

    * ``batch.neighbor_list`` — shape ``(E, 2)``, int32 (nvalchemi convention)
    * ``batch.neighbor_list_shifts`` — shape ``(E, 3)``, int32 (only when PBC active)
    * ``batch.edge_ptr`` — shape ``(N+1,)``, int32, derived on demand via

        Neighbor list configuration read from the model config.

        already included.  The list is only rebuilt when any atom has
        moved more than ``skin / 2`` since the previous build (requires
        ``nvalchemiops >= 0.4``); set to ``0.0`` (default) to rebuild

    max_neighbors : int | None, optional
        Maximum number of neighbors per atom for MATRIX format.  When
        ``None`` (default), auto-estimated from the cutoff via
        ``estimate_max_neighbors(cutoff)``.  Ignored for COO format.
    stage : Enum | None, optional
        The workflow stage at which this hook runs.  Defaults to
        ``DynamicsStage.BEFORE_COMPUTE``.
    use_cuda_graph : bool, optional
