"""Strategy-agnostic core for async comm/compute overlap of the per-layer DD
collective.

A message layer computes, for this rank's **owned receivers**, an aggregation
over edges whose *sender* feature is either already resident on this rank or must
be fetched by the strategy's per-layer exchange (an all-gather for
graph-parallel; an all-to-all ghost borrow for halo). Splitting the owned-receiver
edges by **sender residency** exposes compute that is independent of the exchange:

    handle = exchange.start(owned_x)              # issue the collective (async-capable)
    g_local  = message_fn(owned_x,  local_edges)  # sender resident — runs during the collective
    x_exch   = exchange.wait(handle)              # exchanged features (full for GP; [owned|ghost] halo)
    g_remote = message_fn(x_exch,   remote_edges) # sender needed the exchange
    out      = g_local + g_remote[:n_receivers]   # exact: aggregation is linear over a disjoint split

Only the two seams — :class:`AsyncExchange` and :class:`LocalityPartition` —
vary by strategy, and both are functions of the strategy's *layout* (owner_rank
for GP, n_owned for halo), so the strategy owns them. The model contributes only
its own message-module forward (``message_fn``), invoked once per edge bucket by
a spec-declared adapter — the model body is never edited.

Overlap is **OFF** here (synchronous two-pass): this isolates the correctness of
the split from the scheduling. Enabling the actual concurrency — either via the
inductor compute/comm reorder pass or a manual async handle — is a later phase;
it does not change this contract.

    """Static (per-NL-rebuild) split of a message layer's owned-receiver edges by
    whether the **sender** feature is already resident on this rank.

    Both edge tensors are ``(2, E)`` ``[sender; receiver]``. Receivers are always
    owned (rows ``0:n_receivers``). Sender ids are pre-remapped into the feature
    space each bucket is evaluated in:

    * ``local_edges`` — sender resident; senders indexed into the **owned**
      feature tensor (``0:n_owned``). Computable with no exchange.
    * ``remote_edges`` — sender needs the exchange; senders indexed into the
      **exchanged** feature tensor (full for GP, padded for halo).

    ``n_receivers`` is this rank's owned node count. ``owned_offset`` is where the
    owned receiver rows sit in the **exchanged** feature space that the remote
    pass scatters into: ``0`` for halo (owned block is first in ``[owned|ghost]``),
    but the rank's block offset for graph-parallel (the all-gather concatenates
    owned blocks by rank). The local pass always scatters into ``[0:n_receivers]``
    of the owned tensor; the two buckets are summed over the owned rows.

    ``local_edges`` / ``remote_edges`` serve the simple ``forward(features,
    edge_index)`` message signature (the :func:`run_overlapped` driver). Layers
    whose forward carries **extra per-edge tensors** (e.g. an eSCN conv's
    ``x_edge`` / ``wigner`` alongside ``edge_index``) can't be driven by that
    alone: their adapter must slice every per-edge input by the same split. For
    those, ``local_mask`` / ``remote_mask`` are the boolean per-edge selectors
    (over the original ``E`` edges) and ``local_sender_owned`` is the resident
    senders remapped into owned-feature space (aligned with ``local_mask``); the
    adapter slices its per-edge tensors by the masks, swaps in
    ``local_sender_owned`` for the local pass, and leaves the receiver mapping to
    the model's own scatter (e.g. the conv's ``node_offset``).
