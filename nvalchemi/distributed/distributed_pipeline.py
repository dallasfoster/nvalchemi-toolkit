"""Domain-decomposed composition of models (``DistributedPipelineModel``).

Runs a :class:`~nvalchemi.models.pipeline.PipelineModelWrapper` (e.g.
MACE + DFT-D3, AIMNet2 + PME) under domain decomposition, giving each
sub-model its own right-sized halo over one shared owned partition rather
than forcing every sub-model onto the largest cutoff's ghost region.

The caller builds one ``ShardedBatch`` at the max cutoff (one owned
partition); the composite rebuilds each sub-model's halo over it via
``ShardedBatch.invalidate_padded_view`` between models, so the owned set is
never recomputed. It mirrors
:class:`~nvalchemi.distributed.distributed_model.DistributedModel`'s
context-manager + ``__call__(sharded_batch)`` contract, so it is drop-in for
``BaseDynamics``.

Three group kinds:

* **Direct-force** (``use_autograd=False``): sub-models whose forces are
  direct per-atom kernel outputs (DFT-D3, Lennard-Jones, Ewald / PME with
  ``hybrid_forces=True``) compose by summing owned-aligned per-atom energies /
  forces / stresses — no cross-model autograd.

* **Shared-autograd** (``use_autograd=True``, e.g. MACE energy → ``-dE/dr``):
  the group force is ``-d(ΣE_m)/dr`` over the summed energy. With one shared
  owned partition and no cross-model coupling it decomposes exactly into
  ``Σ_m (-dE_m/dr_owned)``, so each sub-model runs its own autograd forward
  (forces enabled) and the owned-aligned results are summed — identical to a
  single shared ``positions`` leaf with one ``backward()``, while reusing each
  model's eager / compile paths.

* **Wired cross-model fields**: a consumer's energy depends on a per-atom field
  the producer makes (e.g. PME's energy on AIMNet2's ``charges``), so the two
  models share one autograd graph and can't run independently. See
  :meth:`_run_wired_autograd_group`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pipeline : PipelineModelWrapper
        The composed model. Its groups / steps supply the ordered sub-models;
        each sub-model's ``model_config.neighbor_config.cutoff`` sets that
        model's ghost width.
    domain_config : DomainConfig
        Base config carrying the mesh + skin. Per-model configs are derived

        caller should build the shared :class:`ShardedBatch` at (at least) the

    -----
    The composite does not build the ``ShardedBatch`` — the caller does (once,
