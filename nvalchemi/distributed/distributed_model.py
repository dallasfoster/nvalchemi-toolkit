"""Adapter that turns a single-process model wrapper into a distributed callable.

Pattern::

    wrapper    = MACEWrapper.from_checkpoint("small")
    sharded    = ShardedBatch.from_batch(full_batch, mesh=m, config=cfg)
    dist_model = DistributedModel(wrapper, cfg)
    out        = dist_model(sharded)        # dict[str, Tensor]
    e          = out["energy"]              # globally reduced
    f          = out["forces"]              # per-rank owned rows

The adapter owns framework concerns (halo padding, output consolidation) so
inner wrappers stay single-process-focused. Per-model distributed knowledge
lives in the wrapper's ``distribution_spec``.

Composite wrappers (``PipelineModelWrapper``) are rejected here — use
``DistributedPipelineModel`` for distributed composition.
